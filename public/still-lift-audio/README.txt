Place your pre-generated audio files here.

Naming:
- Files are looked up by slug of "{title} {message}" (or just message if no title).
- Characters are lowercased; non-alphanumerics become dashes; trimmed to 120 chars.
- Supported extensions (first match wins): .mp3, .m4a, .ogg, .wav

Example:
- Title: ACTION
- Message: Sit with eyes closed and breathe deeply
- Slug: action-sit-with-eyes-closed-and-breathe-deeply
- File: public/still-lift-audio/action-sit-with-eyes-closed-and-breathe-deeply.mp3

If no file is found, the app falls back to TTS.
